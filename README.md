# Email Service Application

## Overview

This is a **Spring Boot-based Email Service Application** that allows users to send, schedule, and track emails with advanced features like attachments, personalization, and email tracking. The application integrates with popular email-sending services like **SendGrid** and **SMTP** for reliable email delivery. It also includes features like audit logging, rate limiting, and email validation to ensure security and compliance.

## Features

### 1. **Email with Attachment**
- Send emails with attachments (PDF, images, etc.).
- API endpoint to upload files and attach them to emails.

### 2. **Scheduling Emails**
- Schedule emails to be sent at a specific date and time.
- Useful for automated notifications and marketing campaigns.

### 3. **Email Personalization**
- Dynamic content in the email body (e.g., "Hello, [First Name]").
- Supports template engines like **Thymeleaf** or **FreeMarker**.

### 4. **Email Tracking**
- Track whether recipients open emails or click on links.
- Uses tracking pixels and special URLs for tracking.

### 5. **HTML Template Previews**
- Store and reuse email templates (e.g., welcome emails, order confirmations).
- Preview templates before sending.

### 6. **Sending Emails to Multiple Recipients**
- Send emails to multiple recipients (To, CC, BCC).
- Supports bulk emails and group notifications.

### 7. **SendGrid / SMTP Integration**
- Integrates with **SendGrid**, **Amazon SES**, or **SMTP** for scalable and reliable email delivery.

### 8. **Email Reply Handling**
- Specify a `Reply-To` email header to manage replies separately.

### 9. **Rate Limiting**
- Prevent abuse by limiting the number of emails an API key can send within a time frame.

### 10. **Email Signature**
- Configure an email signature that is automatically appended to each email.

### 11. **Email Validation**
- Validate email addresses before sending.
- Checks for proper format and domain validity.

### 12. **Audit Logs**
- Track all sent emails with metadata (timestamps, recipient info, message content).
- Useful for debugging and compliance.

### 13. **Email Language Localization**
- Send emails in different languages based on recipient preferences.
- Accepts a `language` parameter for localized content.

## Rate Limiting

The application enforces rate limiting to prevent abuse. By default:
- Each API key can send **100 emails per hour**.
- To increase the limit, contact the administrator.

---

## Audit Logs

All email-related actions are logged in the `audit_logs` table. Each log entry includes:
- **Action**: The action performed (e.g., "SEND_EMAIL").
- **Entity Name**: The entity involved (e.g., "Email").
- **Entity ID**: The ID of the entity (e.g., email ID).
- **Details**: Additional details about the action.
- **Created By**: The user who performed the action.
- **Created At**: The timestamp of the action.

---

## Email Validation

Before sending an email, the application validates the recipient's email address:
- Checks for proper format (e.g., `user@example.com`).
- Verifies the domain using a third-party service (e.g., Mailgun).

---

## Email Tracking

The application supports email tracking using:
- **Tracking Pixels**: A tiny image embedded in the email to track opens.
- **Special URLs**: Unique URLs to track link clicks.

---

## Localization

To send emails in different languages, include the `language` parameter in the request:
```json
{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "subject": "Hello!",
  "body": "This is a test email.",
  "language": "fr"
}
```
